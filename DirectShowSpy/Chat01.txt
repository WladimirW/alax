 Guest:  Hello Alax
i've just read your post on graph spy
it really sounds very useful
however i'm not shure how to use it
i've regsvr32 it, but i haven't figure it out how use it with other apps's graphs

 me:  Hi there

 me:  Yes you need to regsvr32 and from this point all new filter graphs should be available on running object table so that you connect to them as to remote graphs using GraphEdit
 Sent at 7:08 PM on Thursday
 Guest:  no additional steps are needed ?
i've started some applications and graph edit doesn't detect any remote graph
maybe rebooting the machine ?
 me:  I don't think so, but there is another possible cause
did you at all see any remote graphs using Graph Edit?
after upgrading to XP SP3 you might need to run regsvr32 quartz.dll to get the ability for GraphEdit to see remote graphs again

 Guest:  yes, i have some of my own apps with a ROT reference
if i remove the ROT reference from my code
i'm still unable to reach the remote graph
 me:  ok, so try regsvr32 quartz.dll from windows\system32 folder and see it this is helpful for both my dll and your apps

 Guest:  ok. btw, i forgot to mention that i'm using Vista SP1
 me:  if you can't see your own graphs with graphedit through ROT, then there is definitely some problem...
as for my dll, except for ROT you can check generated log file in C:\ProgramData (this is hidden dir)
if you see it's populating then my dll is intercepting filter graph instantiations

this is the log from your dll

 Guest:  i have executed apps several times and i believe it only logged twice
i regsvr32ed quartz.dll and i believe it made no diference
 me:  these are only log entries generated during registration
 Guest:  ok
than i guess it isn't populating..
 me:  OK, there may be something different on Vista (I am using XP but I was pretty sure it is the same way on Vista) or wrong with the system since you don't see remote graphs
BTW you need to regsvr32 from elevated admin command prompt
(this is to make sure)
 Guest:  yes,i did it on an admin console
i going to try on XP
 Sent at 7:49 PM on Thursday
 Guest:  ok
i installed your dll on a xp system
executed SDP download,

 Guest:  sorry, i checked the log only after removal
 me:  Hold on, I checked the log higher
(this chat window is way too small)
 Guest:  :)
 me:  e.g. there is "CSpy::EnumFilters: ..." which means that it actually worked
there is no other way for these lines to appear in the log other than if the graph is hooked by my dll and it is intercepting all filter graphs
BTW if you run MEdia Player Classic, it also publishes its graph on ROT
and with my DLL you will have two entries there, both point to the same graph
 Guest:  ok i'll check it out
 me:  this is how you can quite easily checkity
 Sent at 8:03 PM on Thursday
 me:  BTW, do you have any objections from putting this chat as a comment to the blog post?
 Sent at 8:06 PM on Thursday
 Guest:  none, be my guest
i'll paste it
ok
on the xp system i don't have the wmp classic installed,
i  have the 11.0.57. version only
i'm reaching the remote graph with graphedit
i don't quite know if this your dll responsability
i guess not
your log remains the same
